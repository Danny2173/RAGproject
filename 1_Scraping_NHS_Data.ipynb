            "Avoid make-up, skincare and suncare products that are oil-based (sometimes labelled “comedogenic”). Use water-based non-comedogenic products, as they’re less likely to block the pores in your skin.\n",

            "\n",
            "Certain hormones cause the grease-producing glands next to hair follicles in the skin to produce larger amounts of oil (abnormal sebum).\n",
            "\n",
            "This abnormal sebum changes the activity of a usually harmless skin bacterium called P. acnes, which becomes more aggressive and causes inflammation and pus.\n",
            "\n",
            "The hormones also thicken the inner lining of the hair follicle, causing blockage of the pores. Cleaning the skin does not help to remove this blockage.\n",
            "\n",
            "h3 Other possible causes\n",
            "\n",
            "Acne is known to run in families. If both your mother and father had acne, it's likely that you'll also have acne.\n",
            "\n",
            "Hormonal changes, such as those that occur during the menstrual cycle or pregnancy, can also lead to episodes of acne in women.\n",
            "\n",
            "There's no evidence that poor hygiene or sexual activity play a role in acne.\n",
            "\n",
            "h2 Who's affected?\n",
            "\n",
            "Acne is very common in teenagers and younger adults. About 95% of people aged 11 to 30 are affected by acne to some extent.\n",
            "\n",
            "Acne is most common in girls from the ages of 14 to 17, and in boys from the ages of 16 to 19.\n",
            "\n",
            "Most people have acne on and off for several years before their symptoms start to improve as they get older.\n",
            "\n",
            "Acne often disappears when a person is in their mid-20s.\n",
            "\n",
            "In some cases, acne can continue into adult life. About 3% of adults have acne over the age of 35.\n",

To reduce the risk for your children:  make sure all medicines, cleaning products, chemicals and potentially harmful cosmetics, such as nail varnish, are locked away out of the sight and out of reach of children  do not store medicines, cleaning products or chemicals near food  keep all chemicals in their original containers and never put medicines or chemicals, such as weedkiller, in soft drinks bottles  when encouraging children to take medicine (when they're sick), do not refer to tablets as sweets  do not leave old medicines lying around - take them to your local pharmacist to dispose of safely  keep cigarettes (including vaping equipment and supplies) and tobacco out of the reach of children and do not smoke in front of children  button batteries, such as those used in watches and also found in greeting cards that play a tune, can be easily swallowed, so keep them and the devices that use them out of reach of children  some plants can be harmful to children so keep a careful eye on them when they are in your garden or outside in an area where plants grow  \"tide pods\" (small capsules of detergent or liquid washing powder) are both dangerous and easily swallowed - keep on a high shelf or similar where young children cannot get to them  whenever possible, buy medicines that come in child-resistant containers  rinse out medicine or cosmetic containers and dispose of them in a place where children cannot reach them  do not take or give medicines in the dark, to avoid taking an incorrect dosage  If you have young children, be extra careful when you have guests to stay or when you go to visit other people.\n",

Depending on the cause, they may also recommend:  medicine to balance your hormones  medicine to balance your insulin levels  changing your medicine to one that does not cause the patches  There's no specific treatment for the patches themselves. A skin specialist (dermatologist) may be able to suggest treatments to improve their appearance, but finding and treating the cause is usually recommended first.\n",

            "Achalasia is a rare disorder of the food pipe (oesophagus), which can make it difficult to swallow food and drink.  Normally, the muscles of the oesophagus contract to squeeze food along towards the stomach. A ring of muscle at the end of the food pipe then relaxes to let food into the stomach.  In achalasia, the muscles in the oesophagus do not contract correctly and the ring of muscle can fail to open properly, or does not open at all. Food and drink cannot pass into the stomach and becomes stuck. It is often brought back up.\n",

            "Not everyone with achalasia will have symptoms.  But most people with achalasia will find it difficult to swallow food or drink (known as dysphagia ). Swallowing tends to get gradually more difficult or painful over a couple of years, to the point where it is sometimes impossible.  Other symptoms include:  bringing back up undigested food  choking and coughing fits  heartburn  chest pain  repeated chest infections  drooling of vomit or saliva  gradual but significant weight loss  Symptoms of achalasia may start at any time of life.  Swallowing problems can also be caused by cancers of the mouth, throat and oesophagus. There’s a link between long-term achalasia and the risk of developing cancer of the oesophagus, but the risk is small.  It’s always important to get symptoms checked straight away, even if your symptoms are not bothering you.\n",

The exact cause of this is unknown.  In some people, it may be linked to a viral infection. It may also be associated with having an autoimmune condition, where the body's immune system attacks healthy cells, tissue and organs.  In rare cases, it's possible that achalasia is caused by a faulty gene.\n",

Achalasia may also be diagnosed during an investigation, such as a chest X-ray, for another reason.  The tests for achalasia include:  manometry - a small plastic tube is passed through your mouth or nose into your oesophagus to measure the muscle pressure along it at different points.  barium swallow - you drink a white liquid containing the chemical barium and X-rays are taken. The barium shows up clearly on X-ray so the doctor can see how long it takes to move into your stomach.  endoscopy - a thin, flexible instrument called an endoscope is passed down your throat to allow the doctor to look directly at the lining of your oesophagus, the ring of muscle and your stomach.\n",

This improves swallowing for most people, but you may need treatment several times before your symptoms improve.  Balloon dilatation does carry a small risk of tearing the oesophagus (oesophageal rupture), which may require emergency surgery.\n",
